Thanks for sending over the test. 
I will be completing it between today and tomorrow.

It seems to me that the specifications are not enough well documented, 
so to avoid confusion, I am going to make assumptions and questions.

Please do correct me if these assumptions are incorrect.

# init method 

JSON format - concepts

According to the specifications (PDF),
the init method is taking a JSON Array formatted as a String.

Each element of this array represents a street in an object that contains: 

- neighborhood : The neighborhood where the street belongs to. ( to group by )
- apartments_height : ???  ( will make some questions below )
- buildings : A list of buildings that belongs to this street 
    [ 
        - name: name of the building  ( just descriptive )
        - apartments_count: number of apartments, assuming 1 apartment per 1 floor
        - distance: distance of?  ( will make some questions below ) 
    ]  


So based on the example diagram:
![](figure0.png)

We will have an "init" JSON array as it follows:
```
[
   {
      "neighborhood": "POBLENOU", 
      "apartments_height": 7,
      "buildings": [
         { "name": "Aticco", apartments_count: 8, distance: null },
         { "name": "01", apartments_count: 4, distance: null },
         { "name": "CEM", apartments_count: 4, distance: null },
         { "name": "30", apartments_count: 4, distance: null },
      ]
   }
]
```
Questions:

1. Is the JSON above well assumed,
2. What is aparments_height on the root of the element?
3. What is distance on each item of the buildings?
4. Is the neighborhood  name supposed to be unique? (to handle errors if more than one is provided).
5. Should I assume the sun is doing a radial from the ground? 

> as per example, if the sunrise is at 08:14 and the sunset at 17:25, noon will be at 12:50,
so at sunrise the sun will be totally at the ground east, noon on the top, and sunset on the ground west. ( just talking out loud to help to define and determine since the specs are not very clear ).


That's all the questions for now.
Looking forward to hearing more from you. 

Kind Regards, 
Albert.
