Ok, so since I'm planning the resolution.
My assumptions are that:


1) apartments_height

apartments_height is the height of every and each apartment of that street, in meters, so this will simplify and help on calculating the building height. 

Let's put as an example that every apartment, or every floor (which is the same in this case), has 10 meters. 

The building Attico, that has 8 apartments (8 floors), has 8*10 meters, 
so Attico is 80m height.

2) distance

distance is the longitude in meters from the previous building, 
in the first case will be zero (because there is no building at the east of the first building)

Based on the picture example and as a rough estimate I could fill it something like:

```
      "buildings": [
         { "name": "Aticco", apartments_count: 8, distance: 0 },
         { "name": "01", apartments_count: 4, distance: 30 },
         { "name": "CEM", apartments_count: 4, distance: 60 },
         { "name": "30", apartments_count: 4, distance: 30 },
      ]
```


3) neighborhood unique

On the previous email I asked:
Is the neighborhood  name supposed to be unique? 

I am replying myself to this as an assumption to YES, hence we don't over engineer it for now.


4 ) radial 

On the previous email I asked:
Should I assume the sun is doing a radial from the ground? 

So I'm guessing trigonometrics should be played to determine until which floor there will be sun, based in distance, and having the time as an input.

Something like this:

getSunlightHours("Poblenou", "Attico", 7) 
> "08:14 - 17:25" 
// there is always light

getSunlightHours("Poblenou", "01", 0) 
> "10:00 - 16:00" 
// (times here are just an estimation: "Attico" and "CEM" are tall, and "01"s ground floor might be affected by this, from the East and West either) 

Assuming all of this is correct, I'm going to proceed with the tests and the algorithm for determining the final hours string.

Please let me know if some concepts are misunderstood, since again, the documentation for the specifications is a bit ambiguous. 

Thanks in advance. 

Kindest, 
Albert.
